   - Check: Step executor handling all node types
   - Check: Context passing between steps
   - Check: Error handling doesn't block execution

**Solution:**
- Check logs together
- Test API with Postman/curl
- Review API documentation

---

### If Dev 4 (Monitoring) Stuck:

**Common Issues:**
1. **"Execution list not loading"**
   - Check: API endpoint returning data
   - Check: Response format matches expected structure
   - Check: Table component configured correctly

2. **"Filters not working"**
   - Check: Query parameters sent correctly
   - Check: Backend filtering logic working
   - Check: State management for filter values

3. **"Real-time updates not working"**
   - Check: Polling interval configured
   - Check: API called on interval
   - Check: State updates trigger re-render

**Solution:**
- Pair for 30 min
- Test API responses with browser dev tools
- Review state management logic

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas (Monitor Daily)

**1. React Flow Integration (Dev 1)**
- **Risk:** Unfamiliar API, complex canvas state management
- **Mitigation:** Dev 1 spends extra time on docs, you pair if stuck
- **Check Daily:** Canvas works, drag-drop works, connections work, state persists

**2. Execution Engine Complexity (Dev 3)**
- **Risk:** Sequential execution with context passing is complex, 30 node types to handle
- **Mitigation:** Clear architecture, TDD, frequent testing, incremental implementation
- **Check Daily:** Execute simple workflow, check logs, verify Shopify integrations

**3. 30 Config Forms (Dev 2 - HIGHEST RISK)**
- **Risk:** MASSIVE amount of repetitive work (110 hours estimated)
- **Mitigation:** Reuse components aggressively, use templates, form generators
- **Check Daily:** Count completed forms (target: 6 per day), adjust if falling behind
- **Contingency:** If Dev 2 falls >2 days behind, Dev 1 helps with simpler forms

**4. Integration Coordination (All Devs)**
- **Risk:** 4 devs working on tightly coupled system, integration issues
- **Mitigation:** Daily integration checks, clear API contracts, frequent communication
- **Check Daily:** All components integrate smoothly, no breaking changes

**5. Shopify Integration (Dev 3)**
- **Risk:** External API dependencies, webhook setup, authentication
- **Mitigation:** Leverage existing Shopify service, test with Shopify test environment
- **Check Daily:** Shopify nodes execute correctly, webhooks received

**6. Monitoring Performance (Dev 4)**
- **Risk:** Large datasets, real-time updates may cause performance issues
- **Mitigation:** Pagination, lazy loading, optimized queries
- **Check Daily:** Dashboard loads quickly with sample data

## Daily Sign-Off Criteria

### Green Light (All Good)
- ‚úÖ All PRs reviewed
- ‚úÖ Today's goals achieved (see daily milestones)
- ‚úÖ Zero blockers
- ‚úÖ Team morale high

### Yellow Light (Watch Closely)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 1 blocker exists but workaround found
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly behind schedule but can catch up
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 1-2 P1 bugs, fixing tomorrow

**Action:** Monitor closely tomorrow, adjust if needed

### Red Light (Intervention Needed)
- üî¥ Multiple blockers, no workarounds
- üî¥ >1 day behind schedule
- üî¥ P0 bugs exist
- üî¥ Team morale low

**Action:**
- Call emergency team meeting
- Re-prioritize (cut scope if needed)
- All hands on deck to fix blocker

---

## Success Indicators (Check Weekly)

### Week 1 (End of Day 5)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Canvas works (drag-drop, connections, state management)
- [ ] ‚úÖ All 30 config forms done (16 original + 14 Shopify)
- [ ] ‚úÖ All 30 node types implemented in execution engine
- [ ] ‚úÖ All 30 node components render on canvas
- [ ] ‚úÖ Monitoring dashboard basic functionality works
- [ ] ‚úÖ Simple workflow executes end-to-end

**If not achieved:**
- If <25 forms done: Dev 1 helps Dev 2 with remaining forms
- If execution engine incomplete: Prioritize most common node types
- Adjust Week 2 plan, cut nice-to-haves (variable insertion, advanced validation)

### Week 2 (End of Day 10)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Validation works (catches all error types)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Monitoring dashboard complete with all features
- [ ] ‚úÖ Integration with existing APIs works (JWT, multi-tenancy)
- [ ] ‚úÖ All 30 node types work in real workflows
- [ ] ‚úÖ Shopify integration verified (triggers and actions)
- [ ] ‚úÖ E2E test passes (covers all major flows)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Performance acceptable (canvas <2s, API <500ms)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Deployed to staging
- [ ] ‚úÖ Demo-ready

**If not achieved:** Emergency sprint review, extend by 1-2 days if critical

---

## Emergency Procedures

### If Critical Blocker Occurs

**Step 1: Stop and Assess (15 min)**
- What's blocked?
- Who's blocked?
- What's the impact?

**Step 2: All-Hands Debug (1 hour max)**
- Everyone stops current work
- Focus on blocker together
- Screen share, debug live

**Step 3: Escalate or Cut Scope**
- If can't fix in 1 hour ‚Üí Escalate (get help from outside)
- If not critical ‚Üí Cut from MVP

---

### If Falling Behind Schedule

**Day 3 Check:**
- If <50% of Week 1 goals achieved ‚Üí Yellow alert
  - Action: Work extra 2 hours/day (Days 4-5)

**Day 5 Check:**
- If <70% of Week 1 goals achieved ‚Üí Red alert
  - Action: Emergency team meeting, cut scope

**Day 8 Check:**
- If <50% of Week 2 goals achieved ‚Üí Red alert
  - Action: Cut nice-to-haves (e.g., variable insertion, polling refresh)
