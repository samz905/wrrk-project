## Unblocking Strategies

### If Dev 2 (Frontend) Stuck:

**Common Issues:**
1. **"React Flow not working"**
   - Check: `import ReactFlow from '@xyflow/react'` (not `react-flow`)
   - Check: `nodeTypes` object correct
   - Check: Nodes have `type` field matching `nodeTypes` key

2. **"Config form not saving"**
   - Check: `onSave` prop passed correctly
   - Check: Zustand state updated
   - Check: Node `data.config` field

3. **"Styles not working"**
   - Check: Tailwind CSS configured
   - Check: Classes correct (no typos)

**Solution:**
- Pair for 30 min
- Share screen, walk through code
- Point to working example

---

### If Dev 3 (Backend) Stuck:

**Common Issues:**
1. **"API returns 500"**
   - Check: Request payload format
   - Check: Backend logs (`console.log` or logging)
   - Check: Database connection

2. **"Integration with BotCore failing"**
   - Check: BotCore running (`http://localhost:5000` accessible)
   - Check: Request format matches BotCore API
   - Check: Response format parsed correctly

3. **"Tests failing"**
   - Read error message carefully
   - Check: Test data correct
   - Check: Mocks configured

**Solution:**
- Check logs together
- Test API with Postman/curl
- Review API documentation

---

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas (Monitor Daily)

**1. React Flow Integration**
- **Risk:** Unfamiliar API
- **Mitigation:** Dev 2 spends extra time on docs, you pair if stuck
- **Check Daily:** Canvas works, drag-drop works, connections work

**2. Execution Engine Complexity**
- **Risk:** Sequential execution with context passing is complex
- **Mitigation:** Clear architecture, TDD, frequent testing
- **Check Daily:** Execute simple workflow, check logs

**3. 16 Config Forms**
- **Risk:** Lots of repetitive work
- **Mitigation:** Reuse components, use templates
- **Check Daily:** Count completed forms, adjust if falling behind

**4. Integration with Existing APIs**
- **Risk:** Undocumented quirks
- **Mitigation:** Document early, test early
- **Check Daily:** Save/load works, data persists correctly

---
